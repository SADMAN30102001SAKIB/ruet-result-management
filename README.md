### Database Management

The SQLite database is automatically created and seeded with sample data in development mode. Sample departments and courses are created for testing purposes.

### Adding New Features

1. Create database schema changes in `lib/database.ts`
2. Add data access functions in `lib/data.ts`
3. Create API routes in `app/api/`
4. Build UI components and pages
5. Update middleware for route protection if needed

## Deployment
