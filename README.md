## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- npm or yarn package manager
- PostgreSQL database (Neon recommended)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd ruet-undergraduate-result-management-system
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

3. Set up environment variables:

Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory:

```env
POSTGRES_URL="your-postgresql-connection-string"
```

For Neon PostgreSQL, get your connection string from your Neon dashboard.

4. Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

5. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser

## Default Credentials

### Admin Login

- **Username**: `admin`
- **Password**: `admin123`

### Student Login

Students can log in using their roll number and registration number (to be created by admin)

## Database Schema

The application uses **PostgreSQL** with the following main tables:

- **admin**: Administrative user accounts
- **departments**: Academic departments (CSE, EEE, ME, etc.)
- **students**: Student profiles and academic information
- **courses**: Course catalog with semester mappings
- **student_courses**: Student course enrollments
- **results**: Academic results and grades

### Database Features

- **Automatic Schema Creation**: Tables and relationships are created automatically
- **Migration Support**: Built-in migration system for schema updates
- **Connection Pooling**: Optimized database connections for scalability
- **Data Integrity**: Foreign key constraints and validation rules

## Key Features Implementation

### Authentication System

- Session-based authentication using cookies
- Role-based access control (admin/student)
- Secure password hashing with bcryptjs
- Protected routes with middleware

### CGPA Calculation

- Automatic SGPA calculation per semester
- Overall CGPA calculation across all semesters
- Credit-weighted grade point averages
- Grade letter assignments based on GPA ranges

### Course Registration System

- Semester-based course enrollment
- Department-specific course catalogs
- Year and semester progression tracking
- Registration validation and constraints

### Modern UI/UX

- Responsive design with CSS Modules
- Form validation and error handling

## Development

### Available Scripts

- `npm run dev` - Start development server
- `npm run build` - Build for production
- `npm run start` - Start production server
- `npm run lint` - Run ESLint

### Database Management

The PostgreSQL database is automatically initialized with the required schema on first run. The system includes:

- **Automatic table creation** with proper relationships
- **Schema migration** support for updates
- **Connection pooling** for optimal performance

### Environment Configuration

Required environment variables:

```env
POSTGRES_URL="postgresql://username:password@host:port/database"
```

### Adding New Features

1. Create database schema changes in `lib/postgres.js`
2. Add data access functions in `lib/data.js`
3. Create API routes in `app/api/`
4. Build UI components and pages
5. Update middleware for route protection if needed

## Deployment

### Production Setup

1. Set up a PostgreSQL database (Neon recommended for serverless)

2. Configure environment variables:

```env
POSTGRES_URL="your-production-postgresql-url"
```

3. Build the application:

```bash
npm run build
```

4. Start the production server:

```bash
npm start
```

The application can be deployed to platforms like Vercel, Netlify, Railway, or any Node.js hosting service that supports PostgreSQL connections.

### Verification

After deployment, run the verification script to ensure all APIs are working:

```bash
node comprehensive-verification.mjs
```
